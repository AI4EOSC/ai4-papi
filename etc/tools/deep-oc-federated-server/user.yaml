# Additional non-customizable values (eg. ports) are hardcoded in `job.nomad`.

# All conf parameters follow the same structure:
# varname:
#  name: name of the parameter to be displayed to end user (mandatory)

  hostname:
    name: Hostname
    value: ''
    description: Host where your application will be deployed (eg. `myapp`). It will automatically default to your `job-uuid`. If the domain has dots in it, we will interpret it as a full domain instead (eg. `myapp.mycompany.com`), which you will need to configure with your DNS provider.

  docker_image:

  docker_tag:
    name: Docker tag
    value: 'latest'
    description: Docker tag to use. Tags are module dependent. You should choose the appropriate tag for your selected hardware (eg. use a `gpu`-like tag if you plan to run on GPUs).

    value: 'fedserver'
    description: When selecting FedServer you won't be able to use JupyterLab, and vice versa. If you want to have access to both services at the same time your best option is to deploy with JupyterLab, then open a terminal window and run FedServer yourself typing `python3 -m fedserver.server`.
    options: ['fedserver', 'jupyter']

  jupyter_password:
    name: IDE password
    value: ''
    description: Select a password for your IDE (JupyterLab or VS Code). It should have at least 9 characters.
